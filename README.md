# Socksy-Dashboard
Socksy Dashboard is an ultra-lightweight, single-file Flask application that continuously probes your SOCKS5 proxies, writes pass/fail + RTT statistics to SQLite, and serves a sleek Bootstrap/DataTables UI where you can watch proxy health in real timeâ€”no Nginx, Redis, or JavaScript build step required.
