## âœ¨ Key Features
| Feature | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **One-file deployment** | Clone â†’ `python app.py` â†’ done. No folder sprawl, perfect for quick VPS or Docker spins. |
| **Auto-probing every 60 s** | A background APScheduler job hits every proxy in parallel (20 threads by default) and updates SQLite. |
| **RTT + success ratio** | See not just *if* a proxy works, but *how fast* it answers. |
| **Bootstrap + DataTables UI** | Sort, filter, paginate, and the URL remembers your table state for easy bookmarking. |
| **In-browser `proxies.txt` editor** | Paste new proxies, hit save, watch them populate instantly. |
| **Stat flush button** | Reset counts without touching the file. |
| **100 % clientless** | Uses `requests[socks]`; no local Tor/Privoxy glue required. |
